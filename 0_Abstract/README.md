# Wiper Control System 

### Here my objective is to demonstrate wiper system using STM-32 board. The board contains 5 LEDS and we have to demonstrate the wiper system using those LEDS.

### Most wipers have a low and a high speed, as well as an intermittent setting. When the wipers are on low and high speed, the motor runs continuously.
### But in the intermittent setting, the wipers stop momentarily between each wipe. There are many different kinds of switches for wipers.
### Some cars have just one intermittent speed, others have 10 discrete settings and still others have a sliding scale that can be set for almost any time interval.
